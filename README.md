Code exercise on Layout and JavaScript


Create a basic responsive page that includes a contact form and JavaScript validation.   

**Page should contain the following:**
*note placeholder content is sufficient(test is for layout not content)*

-	Header
-	sidebar
-	Main content
-	footer

### Choose the basic break points mobile, table, desktop that display 3 distinctive layouts

Main Content should contain a basic contact form with error messaging for fields filled with incorrect information (all should also be responsive)

-	Name(required field)
-	Phone Number
-	Email Address(required field)
-	Subject
-	Message

### Create JavaScript form validation

- Bonus + build the CSS in Sass
- Bonus ++ modern CSS3 layout techniques with appropriate legacy fallbacks


Try to Use:
- SASS or LESS
- Git
- JavaScript/jQuery



### My comments

- so far footer issue, but made it look visually appealing so it's there.
- validation isn't outputting, in the console it shows true or false
`console.log(validName.isValid());`
